  <title>Prathibhotsava | VTU Youth Fest 2022 - BMSCE</title>
  <meta name="title" content="Prathibhotsava | VTU Youth Fest 2022 - BMSCE">
  <meta name="description" content="This year’s VTU youth festival is a splendid celebration of the enthusiasm, energy and sheer talent of the Student Community of the university.
Indian culture and civilization is one of the most ancient civilizations that still exists on the face of the earth. With the advent of time, the cultural heritage of our nation has been nurtured, preserved and promoted by the patronage and support of various empires, kingdoms and rulers in the subcontinent. The plurality and multiplicity of the Indian Culture is evident to the fact that India has one of the world’s largest collections of songs, music, dance, theatre, folk traditions, performing arts, paintings and writings that are known as the ‘Intangible Cultural Heritage’ of humanity. In the 21st century, we witness an inclusive domain of culture by the coalescence of our ancient heritage with the contemporary and modern elements and has formed the cultural fabric of the nation.
With no doubt one can easily identify the fact that the youth of this country are at the forefront of practising, observing and celebrating this cultural identity of India.
Providing the youth with a platform to celebrate their talents and to express themselves through their cultural prowess and skill-set of dance, music, theatre, literary and fine arts, is the 21st VTU Youth Festival - Prathibhotsava, organized by B.M.S. College of Engineering.
